	The anchor element is used to create hyperlinks between a source anchor and a destination anchor. The source is the text,
	image, or button that links to another resource and the destination is the resource that the source anchor links to.
    Hyperlinks are one of the fundamental technologies that make the web the information superhighway, 
    and understanding how to use anchor elements is one of the first things you need to master when learning HTML.
	When writing internal links make sure you don’t overdo it. The link juice of any given web page is shared between the links 
	on the page.So the more links you put on a page, the more diluted the juice passed to each link becomes. A good rule 
	of thumb is to have no more than 100 links per page although there are exceptions in the case of extremely large and complex
	 websites.External links are also important for a few different reasons:External links may be recommended, required, 
	or just best-practice to provide proper attribution to the source of an idea or a resource.External links allow us to refer 
	website visitors to useful related content.When other websites post external links that point at our website, these 
	links known as backlinks allow link juice to flow to our website and improve our website’s position on search engine 
	results pages (SERP).When writing external links try to avoid linking to direct competitors. You don’t want to help their 
	SERP ranking for search terms that you are targeting for your own website. It’s also a good idea to use the 
	target="_blank" attribute when writing external links. By opening external links in a new tab you keep visitors on 
	your site for longer Technology ("science of craft", from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand"; and -λογία, 
	-logia[2]) is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in 
	the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, 
	processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their 
	workings. Systems (e.g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and 
	then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.The simplest form of technology 
	is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic 
	Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control
	their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have 
	lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.Technology has many
	effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a
	leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources
	to the detriment of Earth's environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new 
	questions in the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human 
	productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with 
	disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, 
	and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and 
	alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological 
	progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.

	While the examples above will produce anchor elements they aren’t of much use since we haven’t included any additional 
	instructions. Right now these anchor elements link to nothing. To link a source anchor to a destination anchor, we 
	need to apply some additional attributes to the anchor element.There are at least three good reasons why using generic 
	anchorelement  text such as “Click Here” is a terrible practice.Website visitors who depend on assistive
	technologies such as screen readers will have a hard time deciphering the meaning of links that make use of generic link
	text such as “Click Here”. Website visitors who are scanning a page will have to take several additional
	seconds to investigate the text around the link to have an idea of what the anchor links to.Search engine web crawlers 
	associate anchor element text with the link URL. Properly selected anchor element text helps search enginesdetermine
	the relevance of a web page to specific keywords. Generic text tells search engines nothing about the linked web page.
	HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as 
	interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by 
	denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
	HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as directly introduce content into 
	the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as 
	sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.The use of the 
	term "technology" has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon 
	in English, and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the useful arts[3] or to allude to technical 
	education, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (chartered in 1861).[4]The term "technology" rose to prominence 
	in the 20th century in connection with the Second Industrial Revolution. The term's meanings changed in the early 20th
	century when American social scientists, beginning with Thorstein Veblen, translated ideas from the German concept of 
	Technik into "technology." In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between technik and technologie
	that is absent in English, which usually translates both terms as "technology." By the 1930s, "technology" referred not 
	only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves.[5]In 1937, the American sociologist Read 
	Bain wrote that "technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating
	and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them."[6] Bain's definition remains common among 
	scholars today, especially social scientists. Scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied 
	science, rather than as the things that people make and use.[7] More recently, scholars have borrowed from European 
	philosophers of "technique" to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in Foucault's
	work on technologies of the self (techniques de soi).

	In this short tutorial we’ll cover the attributes you can use to add a destinationanchor to your hyperlinks, 
	tell the browser what to do with the link, and add semantic meaning to anchor elements for browsers and web crawlers 
	to use.Links are also used to tell a browser to start downloading a file.The download attribute is used to 
	identify a link that should initiate a download and the value assigned to the download attribute
	is the name of the file to be downloaded.The first is an example of an absolute URL. Absolute URLs are those that include
	a complete (absolute) description of the link destination. Absolute URLs include the protocol (http) and the complete domain 
	name and file path needed to reach the destination anchor.The second is an example of a relative URL. Relative URLs link to 
	a web page by describing the position of the page relative to the position of the current page. When writing internal 
	links that point to other pages of the same website we have the option of writing relative URLs rather than absolute URLs.
	HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual 
	or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these 
	characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements
	are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early
	text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS 
	(Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by 
	typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements 
	(nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and 
	markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.Dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety 
	of definitions. The Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary offers a definition of the term: "the use of science in 
	industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems" and "a machine, piece of equipment, method,
	etc., that is created by technology."[8] Ursula Franklin, in her 1989 "Real World of Technology" lecture, gave another
	definition of the concept; it is "practice, the way we do things around here."[9] The term is often used to imply a
	specific field of technology, or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics, rather than technology as
	a whole.[10] Bernard Stiegler, in Technics and Time, 1, defines technology in two ways: as "the pursuit of life by means
	other than life," and as "organized inorganic matter."[11]Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both 
	material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. 
	In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching
	term that may include simple tools, such as a crowbar or wooden spoon, or more complex machines, such as a space station 
	or particle accelerator. Tools and machines need not be material; virtual technology, such as computer software and 
	business methods, fall under this definition of technology.[12] W. Brian Arthur defines technology in a similarly broad 
	way as "a means to fulfill a human purpose.

	Relative URLs are very popular with web developers. It is common for websites to be developed on a staging server with a
	domain name that is not the same as the eventual permanent domain name. If relative URLs are used, when the site is 
	transferred from the staging server to being live on the web all of the relative URLs will continue to work just fine. 
	However, if absolute URLs are used the development team will have to go through the site fixing all of the URLs.
	With just the three attributes we’ve covered so far, you can complete every hyperlinking task you will encounter on the web.
	However, there are additional attributes that can be used to tell a visitor’s web browser and search engines that index 
	our website something about the meaning of the hyperlinks.Right now this attribute doesn’t do much of anything,
	but the thinking is that in the future theinformation contained in this attribute could be used to some how
	communicate to a website visitor the type of content they are about to be linked to before clicking on the link.
	Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering 
	Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext 
	Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type 
	definition to define the grammar.[9][10] The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment 
	of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing 
	standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)",
	from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.Technology can be 
	viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture.[14] Additionally, technology is the application of mathematics, 
	science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of communication technology, 
	which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of 
	cyberculture has at its basis the development of the Internet and the computer.[15] Not all technology enhances 
	culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns. 
	As a cultural activity, technology predates both science and engineering, each of which formalize some aspects of 
	technological endeavor.

	Your beloved website pages can be as beautiful and compelling as the internet is vast but the overwhelming majority 
	of your users do not want to spend minutes absorbing, analysing and appreciating them (sorry). They simply want to 
	use the website for its purpose, and anchor links can help them along their way.Think, too, of the way most of us 
	surf the web these days. We’re constantly scrolling through the inane on Twitter (now double the effort thanks to 
	its recently increased character count), endless photos of friends’ squidgy babies and hipster meals on Facebook, 
	and infinite news stories on apps and websites to find what we want. Let’s face it; for some, the thumbs could soon 
	be the most exercised parts of their bodies. HTML 3.0[42] was proposed as a standard to the IETF, but the proposal 
	expired five months later (28 September 1995)[43] without further action. It included many of the capabilities that 
	were in Raggett's HTML+ proposal, such as support for tables, text flow around figures and the display of complex 
	mathematical formulas.W3C began development of its own Arena browser as a test bed for HTML 3 and Cascading Style 
	Sheets,[44][45][46] but HTML 3.0 did not succeed for several reasons. The draft was considered very large at 150 pages
	and the pace of browser development, as well as the number of interested parties, had outstripped the resources of the 
	IETF.[13] Browser vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape at the time, chose to implement different subsets of HTML 3's 
	draft features as well as to introduce their own extensions to it.[13] (see Browser wars). These included extensions to 
	control stylistic aspects of documents, contrary to the "belief [of the academic engineering community] that such things 
	as text color, background texture, font size and font face were definitely outside the scope of a language when their 
	only intent was to specify how a document would be organized."[13] Dave Raggett, who has been a W3C Fellow for many years,
	has commented for example: "To a certain extent, Microsoft built its business on the Web by extending HTML features.
	The exact relations between science and technology, in particular, have been debated by scientists, historians, and 
	policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science.
	In the immediate wake of World War II, for example, it was widely considered in the United States that technology was 
	simply "applied science" and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation 
	of this philosophy could be found explicitly in Vannevar Bush's treatise on postwar science policy, Science – The Endless
	Frontier: "New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature ...
	This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research."[18] In the late-1960s, however, 
	this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted 
	by the scientific community). The issue remains contentious, though most analysts resist the model that technology is a 
	result of scientific research.
